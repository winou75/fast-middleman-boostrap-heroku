#Middleman with bootstrap on Heroku

precompiled and served statically

#Usage

`$ git clone http://github.com/indirect/middleman-heroku-static-app.git mysite && cd mysite`

`$ bundle install && bundle exec middleman init .`

`$ git add . && git commit -m "brand new site"`

`$ heroku create && git push heroku master`

`$ heroku open`

The only expectation is that middleman build will generate your site into ./build. That's where Rack::TryStatic will look.

You can customize the 404 page that's served if TryStatic can't find a file by editing source/404.html.erb.
